Why SICP?  Well, [this guy’s writeup](https://archive.is/uTOol#selection-839.0-880.0) is pretty solid:

## Book and Course Materials

Here’s the book’s [online home](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)

Here's an [online version of the book](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/index.xhtml) that looks a bit less like the website for Space Jam.

Here’s a class from [MIT courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)

In terms of cadence for working through the book:

Here’s the [courseware reading list](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/readings/)

This one's [from the book's site](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/syllabus.html)

## Scheme

The examples for SICP are written in Scheme.  To follow along, there are several alternatives.

Scheme is a dialect of Lisp.  So apparently if you know Common Lisp already, you can fairly easily infer what's going on and use it for all the exercises.  If you don't know CL, your mileage may vary.

Since the course originates at MIT, you might be surprised to discover that they use MIT Scheme. 
```
brew install mit-scheme
```

Here’s a page on [debugging MIT Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-user/Debugging.html#Debugging) which might come in handy.


Or there’s Racket, which is derived from scheme (created by one of the authors of The Little Schemer) and has an SIPC mode:
```
brew cask install racket
```

Racket has an [SICP mode](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html) you can install.

I would imagine someone’s worked through the examples in Clojure. [And so it is!](http://www.sicpdistilled.com)


## Cheating

Here’s [a guy who’s worked through (most of) it](http://www.billthelizard.com/2009/10/sicp-challenge.html)

[Solutions to the exercises](http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions).  Don’t actually look at these:


## Odds and Ends

I’m thinking we should take up a collection and we should have a drawing among whoever makes it to the very end, having completed, let’s say, half the exercises.  And the winner gets a hardcover edition.

[Because the hardcover edition is not cheap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262011530/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0).
